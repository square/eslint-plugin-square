# eslint-plugin-square

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/eslint-plugin-square.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/eslint-plugin-square)
![CI](https://github.com/square/eslint-plugin-square/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

This plugin contains lint rule definitions and configurations for [ESLint](http://eslint.org) specific to Square's needs. It serves mainly to consolidate Square's web frontend linting setup in one place.

## Requirements

* [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) `>= 6`
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) `10.* || 12.* || >= 14.*`

## Usage

Install via yarn (or npm):

```sh
yarn add --dev eslint-plugin-square
```

Edit your `.eslintrc.js` configuration file to extend one of the available configurations from this plugin:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: ['square'],
  extends: ['plugin:square/ember'], // Or other configuration.
};
```

## Configurations

|     | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| | [base] | Rules and configuration for any JavaScript-based project. Includes recommended and optional rules from [eslint], [prettier], [eslint-plugin-eslint-comments], [eslint-plugin-import], [eslint-plugin-unicorn], and more. |
| :fire: | [ember] | [Ember.js]-specific additions on top of `base`. Includes recommended and optional rules from [eslint-plugin-ember], kebab-case filename enforcement with [eslint-plugin-filenames], and more. |
| | [react] | [React](https://reactjs.org)-specific additions on top of `base`. |
| | [typescript] | [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)-specific additions on top of `base`. Use with [@typescript-eslint/parser]. |

Rules enabled by these configurations should meet the following criteria:

* They make sense in a wide variety of codebases (and have been tested in a variety of Square's applications).
* They are generally acceptable and desirable (in terms of enforcing best practices, consistency, avoiding bugs) to most developers.
* There is a practical migration path (autofixers, codemod, find-and-replace, manual fixes) for enabling them in most applications.

Note that we prefer to upstream our custom lint rules to third-party eslint plugins whenever possible. The rules that still remain here are typically here because:

* We haven't found the appropriate eslint plugin to upstream them to.
* We haven't found the time to upstream them.
* They are specific to Square in some way / not generic enough.
