# eslint-plugin-square

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/eslint-plugin-square.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/eslint-plugin-square)
![CI](https://github.com/square/eslint-plugin-square/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

This plugin contains lint rule definitions and configurations for [ESLint](http://eslint.org) specific to Square's needs. It serves mainly to consolidate Square's web frontend linting setup in one place. It is generally **not recommended for public usage** outside of Square.

## Requirements

* [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) `>= 8.18.0`
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) `^14.18.0 || ^16.0.0 || >= 18.0.0`

## Usage

Install via yarn (or npm):

```sh
yarn add --dev eslint-plugin-square
```

Edit your `.eslintrc.js` configuration file to extend one of the available configurations from this plugin:

```js
module.exports = {
  extends: ['plugin:square/base'], // Or other configuration.
};
```

Add the relevant lint scripts in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "npm-run-all --continue-on-error --aggregate-output --parallel lint:*",
    "lint:js": "eslint --cache ."
  }
}
```

And be sure to run linting:

* As a build check during CI
* In your precommit hook (see [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) and [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky))
* With the ESLint extension for your IDE

## Configurations

|     | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| | [base] | Rules and configuration for any JavaScript-based project. Includes recommended and optional rules from [eslint], [prettier], [eslint-plugin-eslint-comments], [eslint-plugin-import], [eslint-plugin-unicorn], and more. |
| ðŸ”¥ | [ember] | [Ember.js]-specific additions on top of `base`. Includes recommended and optional rules from [eslint-plugin-ember], kebab-case filename enforcement with [eslint-plugin-filenames], and more. |
| | [react] | [React](https://reactjs.org)-specific additions on top of `base`. |
| | [strict] | A variety of stricter lint rules on top of `base`. |
| | [typescript] | [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)-specific additions on top of `base`. Use with [@typescript-eslint/parser]. |

Rules enabled by these configurations should meet the following criteria:

* They make sense in a wide variety of codebases (and have been tested in a variety of Square's applications).
* They are generally acceptable and desirable (in terms of enforcing best practices, consistency, avoiding bugs) to most developers.
* There is a practical migration path (autofixers, codemod, find-and-replace, manual fixes) for enabling them in most applications.

## Custom rules

Each rule has emojis denoting:

* What configuration it belongs to
* ðŸ”§ if some problems reported by the rule are automatically fixable by the `--fix` [command line](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface#fixing-problems) option
* ðŸ’¡ if some problems reported by the rule are manually fixable by editor [suggestions](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/working-with-rules#providing-suggestions)

| [no-test-return-value](docs/rules/no-test-return-value.md) | Testing | ðŸ”¥ | | ðŸ’¡ |
| [no-translation-key-interpolation](docs/rules/no-translation-key-interpolation.md) | Ember | ðŸ”¥ | | |
| [require-await-function](docs/rules/require-await-function.md) | JavaScript | ðŸ”¥ | ðŸ”§ | |

| [use-ember-find](docs/rules/use-ember-find.md) | Ember Testing | ðŸ”¥ | ðŸ”§ | |

Note that we prefer to upstream our custom lint rules to third-party ESLint plugins whenever possible. The rules that still remain here are typically here because:

* We haven't found the appropriate ESLint plugin to upstream them to.
* We haven't found the time to upstream them.
* They are specific to Square in some way / not generic enough.
